#About

Hi guys! My name is Autumn Scott, and I am the creator of Inspiration Pool. I created the Inspiration Pool to serve as a landing page for artists to go to when they need that extra does of inspiration.  Let’s be real. We’ve all ran into a stumbling block where we can’t come up with new ideas, we turn to social media, and somehow we end up scrolling through Pinterest or Instagram for an hour. DISTRACTIONS, DISTRACTIONS, DISTRACTIONS. It can be a challenge to find good websites that inspire creativity. There's so much going on in art, and it’s challenging enough to stay up to date with new concepts, without the distractions of social media. With that being said, my goal is to give artists a place to go to when they need fresh ideas or just want to see what new things people are trying in art. I hope to inspire you guys and maybe even introduce you to something new, because I believe as artists we should always be growing and learning. As artists, we have to branch out of our comfort zones and try something new in order to become better. That's what the Inspiration Pool is about.
